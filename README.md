EduResolve Pro: AI-Enhanced Grievance Redressal

Live demo:https://vaishnvikedar6-jpg.github.io/Gemini-3/

A unified communication bridge between Students, Departments, and Administration.

🚀 The Vision
In many educational institutions, grievances are lost in long email chains or physical suggestion boxes. EduResolve Pro digitizes this friction. It provides a real-time, transparent, and categorized communication layer where students feel heard and administrators can make data-driven decisions.

✨ Key Features
1. Dual-Core Interface
Student Portal: A clean, minimal UI to submit grievances with a "Smart Tracker" for instant status updates.

Admin Control Center: A high-level dashboard featuring live analytics, priority filtering, and resolution tracking.

2. Intelligent "Sentiment & Escalation" Engine
The system uses a simulated logic-gate to scan grievance descriptions for critical keywords (e.g., "safety", "harassment").

Auto-Escalation: Issues flagged as "CRITICAL" are highlighted in red and pushed to the top of the Admin feed.

Privacy-First: Includes an Anonymity Toggle to protect student identity while still allowing departmental resolution.

3. Real-Time Communication
Threaded Messaging: Unlike static forms, EduResolve supports a conversational history between the student and the responding official.

Status Lifecycle: Visual indicators for Pending, In-Progress, and Resolved states.

4. Admin Analytics
Live Feed: A dynamic table that updates without refreshing.

Data Export: Capability to generate CSV reports for institutional auditing (Compliance Ready).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling).

Icons: Lucide-JS (High-fidelity vector icons).

Data Persistence: LocalStorage (Simulating a NoSQL database for serverless demo).

Analytics: Chart.js (Ready for visual data representation).

📖 How to Run the Demo
Download the index.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave).

To test the flow:

Switch back to Student and track your ID to see the updated status.

📈 Roadmap for Production
True AI Integration: Connecting the sentiment engine to Gemini API for automated response drafting.

Push Notifications: Integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time mobile alerts.

Blockchain Verification: Storing resolution hashes on-chain for tamper-proof accountability.
